# outpost-dcl
A hackathon experiment using the Decentraland SDK 5.0.

This project is the start of some adventure-game style features that didn't quite turn into a game yet. The main features are:

* Using colliders to get the player vertical.
* Low-poly terrain generated from Unity3D and converted for use in DCL.
* A very rudimentary AI for animals in the environment -- moving toward a simulation-style world (includes a finite state machine structure pulled from TypeState by Erik Onarheim https://github.com/eonarheim/TypeState ).
* The ability to pick up and carry items, and then drop them.
* Model texture animations.
* And probably more...

As usual, GLTF model conversions are weird, as you will plainly see when the rabbits mutate.
